**We Are Leon – Super Creative & Minimal Agency Web Template**

This project represents one of my **first practical steps into frontend development**, where I focused on building a clean, structured, and visually appealing landing page using **pure HTML5 and CSS**—without any frameworks or JavaScript.

The goal of this project was to deeply understand **semantic HTML**, **modern CSS layout techniques**, and how to translate a design concept into a real, responsive webpage.

## ✨ Project Overview

**Leon** is a minimal agency landing page designed to highlight creativity and simplicity.  
The layout is structured, **fully responsive**, easy to navigate, and focused on content clarity.

The project contains **5 main sections**:

1. **Landing Section** – A bold hero section that introduces the agency.
2. **Services** – Showcases what the agency offers in a clean layout.
3. **Portfolio** – Displays selected works/projects.
4. **About** – Provides background information about the agency.
5. **Contact** – Allows users to get in touch easily.

## 🧭 Header & Navigation

- The header includes the **agency logo**.
- A **burger menu icon** is used for navigation.
- On **hover**, the burger menu reveals links to:

This interaction was implemented using **CSS only**, reinforcing my understanding of hover states and positioning.
